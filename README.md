# Lex Programs Repository

Welcome to the Lex Programs repository! This collection is dedicated to showcasing Lex programming examples, demonstrating lexical analysis using Lex, a tool for generating lexical analyzers in C programming.

## Introduction to Lex

Lex is a program generator that aids in the lexical processing of character input streams. It works by recognizing regular expressions and executing specified actions upon identifying those expressions. Lex plays a crucial role in compiler construction, where it generates C code for lexical analysis, tokenizing input streams efficiently.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains various Lex programs highlighting different lexical analysis techniques and applications:

- **Sample Lex Programs**: Basic Lex code examples showcasing fundamental lexical analysis tasks.
  
- **Complex Lexical Analyzers**: Demonstrations of more intricate Lex programs for advanced lexical parsing requirements.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [https://github.com/bishalganai05/LEX-Programs]`.
   
2. **Explore Lex Programs**: Navigate through the repository to access Lex programs available in individual directories.
   
3. **Compile Lex Programs**: Use tools like `flex` (flexible scanner generator) to generate C code from Lex programs and compile them using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).

##How To Run Flex Programs:

- Goto to Command Prompt(cmd)
- Go to the directory where you have saved the program
- Type in command:-  flex filename.l
- Type in command:- gcc lex.yy.c
- Execute/Run for Windows command prompt:-     a.exe
